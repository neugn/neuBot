# neuBot - My personal Chatbot Application

This is an application I plan to start building as I start refreshing my programming skills over time.

To start, the application will be dumb. But I will start building in the smarts slowly. The ultimate goal will be to 
build this into my personal assistant, which I can use it to do my daily chores. There will be many interfaces into a 
variety of external sources driven by secure APIs. It also has to learn, so will include AI/ML functionality.

I am excited by all the possibilities this project can deliver and the utility value it will bring me, as well as the 
joy of building something cool.
